Cryptocurrencies use&nbsp;decentralized control&nbsp;as opposed to centralized digital currency and&nbsp;central banking&nbsp;systems.[5]\r\r\n\nThe decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through&nbsp;distributed ledger&nbsp;technology, typically a&nbsp;blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[6]\r\r\n\nBitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency.[7]&nbsp;Since the release of bitcoin, over 4,000&nbsp;altcoins&nbsp;(alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created.\r\r\n\nContents1History2Formal definition2.1Altcoin2.2Crypto token3Architecture3.1Blockchain3.1.1Timestamping3.2Mining3.2.1GPU price rise3.3Wallets3.4Anonymity3.5Fungibility4Economics4.1Transaction fees4.2Exchanges4.3Atomic swaps4.4ATMs4.5Initial coin offerings5Legality5.1Advertising bans5.2U.S. tax status5.3The legal concern of an unregulated global economy5.4Loss, theft, and fraud5.5Darknet markets6Reception6.1Academic studies7See also8References9Further reading10External linksHistory\r\r\n\nSee also:&nbsp;History of bitcoin\r\r\n\nIn 1983, the American cryptographer&nbsp;David Chaum&nbsp;conceived an anonymous cryptographic&nbsp;electronic money&nbsp;called&nbsp;ecash.[8][9]&nbsp;Later, in 1995, he implemented it through&nbsp;Digicash,[10]&nbsp;an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.\r\r\n\nIn 1996, the&nbsp;NSA&nbsp;published a paper entitled&nbsp;How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system first publishing it in a MIT mailing list[11]&nbsp;and later in 1997, in&nbsp;The American Law Review&nbsp;(Vol. 46, Issue 4).[12]\r\r\n\nIn 1998,&nbsp;Wei Dai&nbsp;published a description of \"b-money\", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.[13]&nbsp;Shortly thereafter,&nbsp;Nick Szabo&nbsp;described&nbsp;bit gold.[14]&nbsp;Like&nbsp;bitcoin&nbsp;and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange,&nbsp;BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a&nbsp;proof of work&nbsp;function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system based on a&nbsp;reusable proof of workwas later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai and Szabo.\r\r\n\nThe first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by&nbsp;pseudonymous&nbsp;developer&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto. It used&nbsp;SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its&nbsp;proof-of-work&nbsp;scheme.[15][16]&nbsp;In April 2011,&nbsp;Namecoin&nbsp;was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized&nbsp;DNS, which would make&nbsp;internet censorship&nbsp;very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011,&nbsp;Litecoin&nbsp;was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use&nbsp;scrypt&nbsp;as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency,&nbsp;Peercoin&nbsp;was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.[17]\r\r\n\nOn 6 August 2014, the UK announced its&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;had been commissioned to do a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they can play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.[18]Formal definition\r\r\n\nAccording to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:[19]The system does not require a central authority, its state is maintained through distributed consensus.The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively&nbsp;cryptographically.The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;entered, the system performs at most one of them.\r\r\n\nIn March 2018, the word&nbsp;cryptocurrency&nbsp;was added to the&nbsp;Merriam-Webster Dictionary.[20]Altcoin\r\r\n\nThe term altcoin has various similar definitions. Stephanie Yang of&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;defined altcoins as \"alternative digital currencies,\"[21]&nbsp;while Paul Vigna, also of&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal, described altcoins as alternative versions of bitcoin.[22]&nbsp;Aaron Hankins of the&nbsp;MarketWatch&nbsp;refers to any cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin as altcoins.[23]Crypto token\r\r\n\nA&nbsp;blockchain&nbsp;account can provide functions other than making payments, for example in&nbsp;decentralized applications&nbsp;or&nbsp;smart contracts. In this case, the units or coins are sometimes referred to as crypto tokens (or cryptotokens).Architecture\r\r\n\nDecentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the&nbsp;Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency by printing units of&nbsp;fiat money&nbsp;or demanding additions to digital banking ledgers. In case of decentralized cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which decentralized cryptocurrencies are based was created by the group or individual known as&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto.[24]\r\r\n\nAs of May 2018, over 1,800 cryptocurrency specifications existed.[25]&nbsp;Within a cryptocurrency system, the safety, integrity and balance of&nbsp;ledgers&nbsp;is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as&nbsp;miners: who use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme.[15]\r\r\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.[26]&nbsp;Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as&nbsp;cash&nbsp;on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for&nbsp;seizure&nbsp;by law enforcement.[1]&nbsp;This difficulty is derived from leveraging cryptographic technologies.Blockchain\r\r\n\nMain article:&nbsp;Blockchain\r\r\n\nThe validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a&nbsp;blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of&nbsp;records, called&nbsp;blocks, which are linked and secured using&nbsp;cryptography.[24][27]&nbsp;Each block typically contains a&nbsp;hash&nbsp;pointer as a link to a previous block,[27]&nbsp;a&nbsp;timestamp&nbsp;and transaction data.[28]&nbsp;By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is \"an open,&nbsp;distributed ledger&nbsp;that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".[29]&nbsp;For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a&nbsp;peer-to-peer&nbsp;network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.\r\r\n\nBlockchains are&nbsp;secure by design&nbsp;and are an example of a distributed computing system with high&nbsp;Byzantine fault tolerance.&nbsp;Decentralized&nbsp;consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.[30]&nbsp;Blockchains solve the&nbsp;double-spending&nbsp;problem without the need of a trusted authority or central&nbsp;server, assuming no&nbsp;51% attack&nbsp;(that has worked against several cryptocurrencies).Timestamping\r\r\n\nCryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\r\r\n\nThe first timestamping scheme invented was the&nbsp;proof-of-work&nbsp;scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and&nbsp;scrypt.[17]\r\r\n\nSome other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include&nbsp;CryptoNight,&nbsp;Blake,&nbsp;SHA-3, and&nbsp;X11.\r\r\n\nThe proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined&nbsp;proof-of-work/proof-of-stake&nbsp;scheme.[17]Mining\r\r\n\n\r\r\n\n\t\r\r\n\nHashcoin&nbsp;mine\r\r\n\nIn cryptocurrency networks,&nbsp;mining&nbsp;is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases&nbsp;transaction fees&nbsp;by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as&nbsp;FPGAs&nbsp;and&nbsp;ASICs&nbsp;running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and Scrypt.[31]&nbsp;This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has been on since the day the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was introduced in 2009.[31]&nbsp;With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for this validation has become far more complex over the years, with miners having to invest large sums of money on employing multiple high performance ASICs. Thus the value of the currency obtained for finding a hash often does not justify the amount of money spent on setting up the machines, the cooling facilities to overcome the enormous amount of heat they produce, and the electricity required to run them.[31][32]\r\r\n\nSome&nbsp;miners pool resources, sharing their&nbsp;processing power&nbsp;over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a&nbsp;block. A \"share\" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial&nbsp;proof-of-work.\r\r\n\nAs of February&nbsp;2018, the Chinese Government halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining. Some Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada.[33]&nbsp;One company is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites, due to low gas prices.[34]&nbsp;In June 2018,&nbsp;Hydro Quebec&nbsp;proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 MW to crypto companies for mining.[35]&nbsp;According to a February 2018 report from&nbsp;Fortune,[36]&nbsp;Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity. Prices are contained because nearly all of the country's energy comes from renewable sources, prompting more mining companies to consider opening operations in Iceland. The region's energy company says bitcoin mining is becoming so popular that the country will likely use more electricity to mine coins than power homes in 2018. In October 2018 Russia was to become home to one of the largest legal mining operations in the world, located in&nbsp;Siberia.[citation needed]\r\r\n\nIn March 2018, a town in Upstate New York put an 18-month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the \"character and direction\" of the city.[37]GPU price rise\r\r\n\nAn increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand of&nbsp;graphics cards&nbsp;(GPU) in 2017.[38]&nbsp;Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's&nbsp;GTX 1060&nbsp;and&nbsp;GTX 1070&nbsp;graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price&nbsp; or were out of stock.[39]&nbsp;A GTX 1070 Ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1100. Another popular card GTX 1060's 6 GB model was released at an MSRP of $250, sold for almost $500. RX 570 and RX 580 cards from&nbsp;AMD&nbsp;were out of stock for almost a year. Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPU's as soon as they are available.[40]\r\r\n\nNvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners. \"Gamers come first for&nbsp;Nvidia,\" said Boris Bhles, PR manager for&nbsp;Nvidia&nbsp;in the German region.[41]Wallets\r\r\n\n\r\r\n\n\t\r\r\n\nAn example paper printable bitcoin wallet consisting of one bitcoin address for receiving and the corresponding private key for spending\r\r\n\nMain article:&nbsp;Cryptocurrency wallet\r\r\n\nA&nbsp;cryptocurrency wallet&nbsp;stores the&nbsp;public and private \"keys\"&nbsp;or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency. With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.Anonymity\r\r\n\nBitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous in that the cryptocurrency within a wallet is not tied to people, but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\").[42]&nbsp;Thereby, bitcoin owners are not identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain. Still,&nbsp;cryptocurrency exchanges&nbsp;are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.\r\r\n\nAdditions such as&nbsp;Zerocoin, Zerocash and&nbsp;CryptoNote&nbsp;have been suggested, which would allow for additional&nbsp;anonymity&nbsp;and fungibility.[43][44]Fungibility\r\r\n\nMain articles:&nbsp;Fungibility&nbsp;and&nbsp;Non-fungible token\r\r\n\nMost cryptocurrency tokens are fungible and interchangeable. However, unique&nbsp;non-fungible tokens&nbsp;also exist. Such tokens can serve as assets in games like&nbsp;CryptoKitties.Economics\r\r\n\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily outside existing banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.Transaction fees\r\r\n\nTransaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the&nbsp;supply&nbsp;of network capacity at the time, versus the&nbsp;demand&nbsp;from the currency holder for a faster transaction. The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest. Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time.\r\r\n\nFor&nbsp;ether, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses&nbsp;SegWit. In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.017,[45]&nbsp;while for bitcoin it corresponded to $0.55.[46]Exchanges\r\r\n\nMain article:&nbsp;Cryptocurrency exchange\r\r\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges&nbsp;allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional&nbsp;fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.Atomic swaps\r\r\n\nAtomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange.ATMs\r\r\n\n\r\r\n\n\t\r\r\n\nBitcoin ATM\r\r\n\nJordan Kelley, founder of&nbsp;Robocoin, launched the first&nbsp;bitcoin ATM&nbsp;in the United States on 20 February 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.[47]Initial coin offerings\r\r\n\nAn&nbsp;initial coin offering&nbsp;(ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or ether.[48][49][50]\r\r\n\nAccording to&nbsp;PricewaterhouseCoopers, four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used&nbsp;Switzerland&nbsp;as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations. The Swiss regulatory agency&nbsp;FINMA&nbsp;stated that it would take a \"balanced approach\" to ICO projects and would allow \"legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.\" In response to numerous requests by industry representatives, a legislative ICO working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018, which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices.[51]Legality\r\r\n\nMain article:&nbsp;Legality of bitcoin by country or territory\r\r\n\nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade,[52]&nbsp;others have banned or restricted it. According to the&nbsp;Library of Congress, an \"absolute ban\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in eight countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. An \"implicit ban\" applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.[53]&nbsp;In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the&nbsp;North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating \"bitcoin scams\" and&nbsp;ICOs&nbsp;in 40 jurisdictions.[54]\r\r\n\nVarious government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoin differently.&nbsp;China Central Bank&nbsp;banned the handling of bitcoins by financial institutions in&nbsp;China&nbsp;in early 2014.\r\r\n\nIn Russia, though cryptocurrencies are legal, it is illegal to actually purchase goods with any currency other than the&nbsp;Russian ruble.[55]&nbsp;Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.[56]\r\r\n\nCryptocurrencies are a potential tool to evade economic sanctions for example against&nbsp;Russia,&nbsp;Iran, or&nbsp;Venezuela. In April 2018, Russian and Iranian economic representatives met to discuss how to bypass the global&nbsp;SWIFT&nbsp;system through decentralized blockchain technology.[57]&nbsp;Russia also secretly supported Venezuela with the creation of the&nbsp;petro&nbsp;(El Petro), a national cryptocurrency initiated by the&nbsp;Maduro&nbsp;government to obtain valuable oil revenues by circumventing US sanctions.\r\r\n\nIn August 2018, the&nbsp;Bank of Thailand&nbsp;announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).[58]Advertising bans\r\r\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrency advertisements were temporarily banned on&nbsp;Facebook,[59]&nbsp;Google,&nbsp;Twitter,[60]&nbsp;Bing,[61]&nbsp;Snapchat,&nbsp;LinkedIn&nbsp;and&nbsp;MailChimp.[62]&nbsp;Chinese internet platforms&nbsp;Baidu,&nbsp;Tencent, and&nbsp;Weibo&nbsp;have also prohibited bitcoin advertisements. The Japanese platform&nbsp;Line&nbsp;and the Russian platform&nbsp;Yandex&nbsp;have similar prohibitions.[63]U.S. tax status\r\r\n\nOn 25 March 2014, the United States&nbsp;Internal Revenue Service&nbsp;(IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes. This means bitcoin will be subject to&nbsp;capital gains tax.[64]&nbsp;In a paper published by researchers from Oxford and Warwick, it was shown that bitcoin has some characteristics more like the precious metals market than traditional currencies, hence in agreement with the IRS decision even if based on different reasons.[65]The legal concern of an unregulated global economy\r\r\n\nAs the popularity of and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009,[66]&nbsp;so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society. Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals.[67]\r\r\n\nCryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and&nbsp;launder money.\r\r\n\nTransactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.[67]\r\r\n\nSystems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money. Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions.[67]Loss, theft, and fraud\r\r\n\nMain article:&nbsp;Cryptocurrency and security\r\r\n\nIn February 2014 the world's largest bitcoin exchange,&nbsp;Mt. Gox, declared&nbsp;bankruptcy. The company stated that it had lost nearly $473 million of their customers' bitcoins likely due to theft. This was equivalent to approximately 750,000 bitcoins, or about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February.[68]\r\r\n\nTwo members of the Silk Road Task Forcea multi-agency federal task force that carried out the U.S. investigation of&nbsp;Silk Roadseized bitcoins for their own use in the course of the investigation.[69]&nbsp;DEA&nbsp;agent Carl Mark Force IV, who attempted to extort Silk Road founder&nbsp;Ross Ulbricht&nbsp;(\"Dread Pirate Roberts\"), pleaded guilty to money laundering,&nbsp;obstruction of justice, and extortion under color of official right, and was sentenced to 6.5 years in federal prison.[69]&nbsp;U.S. Secret Service&nbsp;agent Shaun Bridges pleaded guilty to crimes relating to his diversion of $800,000 worth of bitcoins to his personal account during the investigation, and also separately pleaded guilty to money laundering in connection with another cryptocurrency theft; he was sentenced to nearly eight years in federal prison.[70]\r\r\n\nHomero Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a&nbsp;plea agreement&nbsp;that the companies were part of a&nbsp;pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to&nbsp;wire fraud&nbsp;in 2015. The U.S.&nbsp;Securities and Exchange Commission&nbsp;separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his companies, had fraudulently sold \"investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated\" from mining.[71]\r\r\n\nOn 21 November 2017, the&nbsp;Tether cryptocurrency&nbsp;announced they were hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from their primary wallet.[72]&nbsp;The company has 'tagged' the stolen currency, hoping to 'lock' them in the hacker's wallet (making them unspendable). Tether indicates that it is building a new core for its primary wallet in response to the attack in order to prevent the stolen coins from being used.\r\r\n\nIn May 2018,&nbsp;Bitcoin Gold&nbsp;(and two other cryptocurrencies) were hit by a successful 51% hashing attack by an unknown actor, in which exchanges lost estimated $18m.[73]&nbsp;In June 2018, Korean exchange&nbsp;Coinrail was hacked, losing US$37 million worth of altcoin. Fear surrounding the hack was blamed for a $42 billion cryptocurrency market selloff.[74]&nbsp;On 9 July 2018 the exchange Bancor had $23.5 million in cryptocurrency stolen.[75]\r\r\n\nThe French regulator&nbsp;Autorit des marchs financiers&nbsp;(AMF) lists 15 websites of companies that solicit investment in cryptocurrency without being authorised to do so in France.[76]Darknet markets\r\r\n\nMain article:&nbsp;Darknet market\r\r\n\nProperties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of&nbsp;online black markets, such as&nbsp;Silk Road.[67]&nbsp;The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000.[67]\r\r\n\nDarknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Bitcoins and other forms of cryptocurrency used in dark markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the U.S., bitcoins are labelled as \"virtual assets\". This type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets.[77]Reception\r\r\n\nCryptocurrencies have been compared to&nbsp;Ponzi schemes,&nbsp;pyramid schemes[78]&nbsp;and&nbsp;economic bubbles,[79]&nbsp;such as&nbsp;housing market bubbles.[80]&nbsp;Howard Marks&nbsp;of&nbsp;Oaktree Capital Management&nbsp;stated in 2017 that digital currencies were \"nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it\", and compared them to the&nbsp;tulip mania&nbsp;(1637),&nbsp;South Sea Bubble&nbsp;(1720), and&nbsp;dot-com bubble&nbsp;(1999).[81]\r\r\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are managed through advanced encryption techniques, many governments have taken a cautious approach toward them, fearing their lack of central control and the effects they could have on financial security.[82]Regulators in several countries have warned against cryptocurrency and some have taken concrete regulatory measures to dissuade users.[83]&nbsp;Additionally, many banks do not offer services for cryptocurrencies and can refuse to offer services to virtual-currency companies.[84]&nbsp;Gareth Murphy, a senior central banking officer has stated \"widespread use [of cryptocurrency] would also make it more difficult for statistical agencies to gather data on economic activity, which are used by governments to steer the economy\". He cautioned that virtual currencies pose a new challenge to central banks' control over the important functions of monetary and exchange rate policy.[85]&nbsp;While traditional financial products have strong consumer protections in place, there is no intermediary with the power to limit consumer losses if bitcoins are lost or stolen.[86]&nbsp;One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards, for example, is consumer protection against fraud, such as&nbsp;chargebacks.\r\r\n\nAn enormous amount of energy goes into&nbsp;proof-of-work&nbsp;cryptocurrency mining, although cryptocurrency proponents claim it is important to compare it to the consumption of the traditional financial system.[87]\r\r\n\nThere are also purely technical elements to consider. For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized&nbsp;hardware&nbsp;and&nbsp;software.[88]&nbsp;Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction. Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media. This prevents the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets.[89]\r\r\n\nThe cryptocurrency community refers to pre-mining, hidden launches,&nbsp;ICO&nbsp;or extreme rewards for the altcoin founders as a deceptive practice.[90]&nbsp;It can also be used as an inherent part of a cryptocurrency's design.[91]&nbsp;Pre-mining means currency is generated by the currency's founders prior to being released to the public.[92]\r\r\n\nPaul Krugman,&nbsp;Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences&nbsp;winner does not like bitcoin, has repeated numerous times that it is a bubble that will not last[93]&nbsp;and links it to&nbsp;Tulip mania.[94]&nbsp;American business magnate&nbsp;Warren Buffett&nbsp;thinks that cryptocurrency will come to a bad ending.[95]&nbsp;In October 2017,&nbsp;BlackRock&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;Laurence D. Fink&nbsp;called bitcoin an 'index of&nbsp;money laundering'.[96]&nbsp;\"Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world,\" he said.Academic studies\r\r\n\nMain article:&nbsp;Ledger (journal)\r\r\n\nIn September 2015, the establishment of the&nbsp;peer-reviewed&nbsp;academic journal&nbsp;Ledger&nbsp;(ISSN&nbsp;2379-5980) was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the&nbsp;University of Pittsburgh.[97]\r\r\n\nThe journal encourages authors to&nbsp;digitally sign&nbsp;a&nbsp;file hash&nbsp;of submitted papers, which will then be&nbsp;timestamped&nbsp;into the bitcoin&nbsp;blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.[98][99]See also\r\r\n\nInformation technology portalBusiness and economics portal2018 crypto crashCrypto-anarchismCryptocurrency bubbleCryptocurrency exchangeCryptographic protocolList of cryptocurrenciesVirtual currency law in the United StatesReferences^&nbsp;Jump up to:a&nbsp;b&nbsp;Andy Greenberg (20 April 2011).&nbsp;\"Crypto Currency\".

In 1983, the American cryptographer&nbsp;David Chaum&nbsp;conceived an anonymous cryptographic&nbsp;electronic money&nbsp;called&nbsp;ecash. [8][9]&nbsp;Later, in 1995, he implemented it through&nbsp;Digicash,[10]&nbsp;an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. In 1996, the&nbsp;NSA&nbsp;published a paper entitled&nbsp;How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system first publishing it in a MIT mailing list[11]&nbsp;and later in 1997, in&nbsp;The American Law Review&nbsp;(Vol. In 1998,&nbsp;Wei Dai&nbsp;published a description of \"b-money\", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. [14]&nbsp;Like&nbsp;bitcoin&nbsp;and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange,&nbsp;BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a&nbsp;proof of work&nbsp;function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system based on a&nbsp;reusable proof of workwas later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai and Szabo. The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by&nbsp;pseudonymous&nbsp;developer&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto. It used&nbsp;SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its&nbsp;proof-of-work&nbsp;scheme. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use&nbsp;scrypt&nbsp;as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency,&nbsp;Peercoin&nbsp;was the first to use a proof-of-work. An increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand of&nbsp;graphics cards&nbsp;(GPU) in 2017. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as&nbsp;FPGAs&nbsp;and&nbsp;ASICs&nbsp;running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and Scrypt. Homero Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a&nbsp;plea agreement&nbsp;that the companies were part of a&nbsp;pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to&nbsp;wire fraud&nbsp;in 2015. According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:[19]The system does not require a central authority, its state is maintained through distributed consensus. As of May 2018, over 1,800 cryptocurrency specifications existed. Retrieved&nbsp;20 January&nbsp;2019. Retrieved&nbsp;11 January&nbsp;2018. Retrieved&nbsp;11 January&nbsp;2018. ^&nbsp;Laurie, Law,; Susan, Sabett,; Jerry, Solinas, (11 January 1997). Soon after, in October 2011,&nbsp;Litecoin&nbsp;was released. [15][16]&nbsp;In April 2011,&nbsp;Namecoin&nbsp;was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized&nbsp;DNS, which would make&nbsp;internet censorship&nbsp;very difficult. The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through&nbsp;distributed ledger&nbsp;technology, typically a&nbsp;blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database. 1Blockchain3. A&nbsp;blockchain&nbsp;account can provide functions other than making payments, for example in&nbsp;decentralized applications&nbsp;or&nbsp;smart contracts. Blockchain. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the&nbsp;Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency by printing units of&nbsp;fiat money&nbsp;or demanding additions to digital banking ledgers. [31]&nbsp;With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for this validation has become far more complex over the years, with miners having to invest large sums of money on employing multiple high performance ASICs. 2Exchanges4. Still,&nbsp;cryptocurrency exchanges&nbsp;are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users. Cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside existing banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet. 5Darknet markets6Reception6. [22]&nbsp;Aaron Hankins of the&nbsp;MarketWatch&nbsp;refers to any cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin as altcoins. [64]&nbsp;In a paper published by researchers from Oxford and Warwick, it was shown that bitcoin has some characteristics more like the precious metals market than traditional currencies, hence in agreement with the IRS decision even if based on different reasons. In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0. [7]&nbsp;Since the release of bitcoin, over 4,000&nbsp;altcoins&nbsp;(alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created. 1Altcoin2. 5Initial coin offerings5Legality5. 1Academic studies7See also8References9Further reading10External linksHistory. See also:&nbsp;History of bitcoin. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered. As of February&nbsp;2018, the Chinese Government halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining. [67]&nbsp;The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. 3The legal concern of an unregulated global economy5. Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation. [29]&nbsp;For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a&nbsp;peer-to-peer&nbsp;network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority. Cryptocurrencies are a kind of&nbsp;alternative currency&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital currency&nbsp;(of which&nbsp;virtual currency&nbsp;is a subset).

On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;had been commissioned to do a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they can play in the UK economy. In this case, the units or coins are sometimes referred to as crypto tokens (or cryptotokens). [25]&nbsp;Within a cryptocurrency system, the safety, integrity and balance of&nbsp;ledgers&nbsp;is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as&nbsp;miners: who use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme. [24][27]&nbsp;Each block typically contains a&nbsp;hash&nbsp;pointer as a link to a previous block,[27]&nbsp;a&nbsp;timestamp&nbsp;and transaction data. Timestamping. Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party. The first timestamping scheme invented was the&nbsp;proof-of-work&nbsp;scheme. Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the&nbsp;supply&nbsp;of network capacity at the time, versus the&nbsp;demand&nbsp;from the currency holder for a faster transaction. 1. 2Crypto token3Architecture3. 2Mining3. 2.

[26]&nbsp;Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as&nbsp;cash&nbsp;on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for&nbsp;seizure&nbsp;by law enforcement. ^&nbsp;Eaglesham, Jean; Michaels, Dave (26 December 2018). Stephanie Yang of&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;defined altcoins as \"alternative digital currencies,\"[21]&nbsp;while Paul Vigna, also of&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal, described altcoins as alternative versions of bitcoin. [34]&nbsp;In June 2018,&nbsp;Hydro Quebec&nbsp;proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 MW to crypto companies for mining. While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade,[52]&nbsp;others have banned or restricted it. The company stated that it had lost nearly $473 million of their customers bitcoins likely due to theft. In case of decentralized cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it.",

Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat</em>-<em>pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p><br></p><p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p><p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p><p><br></p><p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p><p><br></p><p>`Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)</p><p><br></p><p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end! `I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p><p><br></p><p>Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right <em>through</em> the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad there <em>was</em> no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy <em>curtseying</em> as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p><p><br></p><p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p><p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p><br></p><p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p><p><br></p><p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p><p>It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p><p><br></p><p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked `poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p><p><br></p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * </p><p><br></p><p>`What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up like a telescope.'</p><p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p><p><br></p><p>`Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make <em>one</em> respectable person!'</p><p><br></p><p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'</p><p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p><p><br></p><p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>",

                "html": "<blockquote>‚ÄúGreetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon‚Äôs graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‚ÄúMorning, boys. How‚Äôs the water?‚Äù And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‚ÄúWhat the hell is water?‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote>This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you‚Äôre worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don‚Äôt be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.</blockquote><blockquote>Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I‚Äôm supposed to talk about your liberal arts education‚Äôs meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let‚Äôs talk about the single most pervasive clich√© in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about ‚Äúteaching you how to think.‚Äù If you‚Äôre like me as a student, you‚Äôve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I‚Äôm going to posit to you that the liberal arts clich√© turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we‚Äôre supposed to get in a place like this isn‚Äôt really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I‚Äôd ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.</blockquote><blockquote>Here‚Äôs another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt have actual reasons for not believing in God. It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn‚Äôt see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out ‚ÄòOh, God, if there is a God, I‚Äôm lost in this blizzard, and I‚Äôm gonna die if you don‚Äôt help me.‚Äô‚Äù And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. ‚ÄúWell then you must believe now,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúAfter all, here you are, alive.‚Äù The atheist just rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúNo, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote>It‚Äôs easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people‚Äôs two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy‚Äôs interpretation is true and the other guy‚Äôs is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person‚Äôs most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there‚Äôs the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They‚Äôre probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists‚Äô problem is exactly the same as the story‚Äôs unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs locked up.</blockquote><blockquote>The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.</blockquote><blockquote>Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it‚Äôs so socially repulsive. But it‚Äôs pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people‚Äôs thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.</blockquote><blockquote>Please don‚Äôt worry that I‚Äôm getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It‚Äôs a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being ‚Äúwell-adjusted‚Äù, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.</blockquote><blockquote>Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education‚Äìleast in my own case‚Äìis that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualise stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.</blockquote><blockquote>As I‚Äôm sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts clich√© about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich√© about ‚Äúthe mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote>This, like many clich√©s, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.</blockquote><blockquote>And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let‚Äôs get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what ‚Äúday in day out‚Äù really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I‚Äôm talking about.</blockquote><blockquote>By way of example, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you‚Äôre tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there‚Äôs no food at home. You haven‚Äôt had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It‚Äôs the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it‚Äôs the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it‚Äôs pretty much the last place you want to be but you can‚Äôt just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store‚Äôs confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren‚Äôt enough check-out lanes open even though it‚Äôs the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can‚Äôt take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.</blockquote><blockquote>But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line‚Äôs front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to ‚ÄúHave a nice day‚Äù in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.</blockquote><blockquote>Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn‚Äôt yet been part of you graduates‚Äô actual life routine, day after week after month after year.</blockquote><blockquote>But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don‚Äôt make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I‚Äôm gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it‚Äôs going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.</blockquote><blockquote>Or, of course, if I‚Äôm in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV‚Äôs and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause] ‚Äî this is an example of how NOT to think, though ‚Äî most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children‚Äôs children will despise us for wasting all the future‚Äôs fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.</blockquote><blockquote>You get the idea.</blockquote><blockquote>If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn‚Äôt have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It‚Äôs the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I‚Äôm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world‚Äôs priorities.</blockquote><blockquote>The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it‚Äôs not impossible that some of these people in SUV‚Äôs have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he‚Äôs trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he‚Äôs in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.</blockquote><blockquote>Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket‚Äôs checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.</blockquote><blockquote>Again, please don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm giving you moral advice, or that I‚Äôm saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it‚Äôs hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won‚Äôt be able to do it, or you just flat out won‚Äôt want to.</blockquote><blockquote>But most days, if you‚Äôre aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she‚Äôs not usually like this. Maybe she‚Äôs been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it‚Äôs also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you‚Äôre automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won‚Äôt consider possibilities that aren‚Äôt annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.</blockquote><blockquote>Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that‚Äôs capital-T True is that you get to decide how you‚Äôre gonna try to see it.</blockquote><blockquote>This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted.

                "strippedText": "Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyons graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says Morning, boys. Hows the water? And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes What the hell is water?This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if youre worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please dont be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that Im supposed to talk about your liberal arts educations meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So lets talk about the single most pervasive clich in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about teaching you how to think. If youre like me as a student, youve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But Im going to posit to you that the liberal arts clich turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that were supposed to get in a place like this isnt really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, Id ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.Heres another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: Look, its not like I dont have actual reasons for not believing in God. Its not like I havent ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldnt see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out Oh, God, if there is a God, Im lost in this blizzard, and Im gonna die if you dont help me. And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. Well then you must believe now, he says, After all, here you are, alive. The atheist just rolls his eyes. No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.Its easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those peoples two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guys interpretation is true and the other guys is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a persons most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, theres the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. Theyre probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists problem is exactly the same as the storys unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesnt even know hes locked up.The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because its so socially repulsive. But its pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other peoples thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.Please dont worry that Im getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. Its a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being well-adjusted, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic educationleast in my own caseis that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualise stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.As Im sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts clich about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich about the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.This, like many clichs, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Lets get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what day in day out really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what Im talking about.By way of example, lets say its an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day youre tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember theres no food at home. You havent had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. Its the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course its the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and its pretty much the last place you want to be but you cant just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit stores confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there arent enough check-out lanes open even though its the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you cant take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.But anyway, you finally get to the checkout lines front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to Have a nice day in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasnt yet been part of you graduates actual life routine, day after week after month after year.But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I dont make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, Im gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and its going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.Or, of course, if Im in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUVs and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause]  this is an example of how NOT to think, though  most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our childrens children will despise us for wasting all the futures fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.You get the idea.If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesnt have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. Its the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when Im operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the worlds priorities.The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, its not impossible that some of these people in SUVs have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and hes trying to get this kid to the hospital, and hes in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarkets checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.Again, please dont think that Im giving you moral advice, or that Im saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because its hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you wont be able to do it, or you just flat out wont want to.But most days, if youre aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe shes not usually like this. Maybe shes been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but its also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If youre automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably wont consider possibilities that arent annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing thats capital-T True is that you get to decide how youre gonna try to see it.This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesnt. You get to decide what to worship.Because heres something else thats weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.

Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you.

The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.

Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyons graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says Morning, boys. So lets talk about the single most pervasive clich in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about teaching you how to think. But Im going to posit to you that the liberal arts clich turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that were supposed to get in a place like this isnt really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if youre worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please dont be. Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that Im supposed to talk about your liberal arts educations meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Its easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those peoples two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. You get to decide what to worship. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. Other peoples thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real. As if a persons most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. If youre like me as a student, youve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, Id ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldnt see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out Oh, God, if there is a God, Im lost in this blizzard, and Im gonna die if you dont help me. And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. Its a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self.",
